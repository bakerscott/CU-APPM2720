A couple of quick thoughts on dataset:
* Lahman or Retrosheet baseball stats-- some of these are not "tidy" based on experience
* Weather data from somewhere-- could also find data with "holes"
* Google public datasets-- lots of them out there
* Use an API to snag our own data? (scott could run this)
