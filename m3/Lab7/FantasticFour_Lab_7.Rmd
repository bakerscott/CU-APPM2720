A couple of quick thoughts on dataset:
* Lahman or Retrosheet baseball stats-- some of these are not "tidy" based on experience
* Weather data from somewhere-- could also find data with "holes"
* Google public datasets-- lots of them out there
* Use an API to snag our own data? (scott could run this)
* Go check out catalog.data.gov
* scott's favorite so far: https://www.kaggle.com/noaa/seismic-waves/data
* airline fleet data, might need some tidying https://www.kaggle.com/traceyvanp/airlinefleet/data
