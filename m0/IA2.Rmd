* I would like to know the relationship between the length of cell phone use at night and how many hours of sleep a person gets.
* In six months after I graduate I would love to work for Lockheed Martin or Boeing. Five years after that, I would love to live abroad in Europe.
* I hope my greatest career accomplishment would be getting the opportunity to work for NASA.
* I hope to gain experience using R and methods in analyzing data.
* I started skiing in 2nd grade and have loved it ever since.
