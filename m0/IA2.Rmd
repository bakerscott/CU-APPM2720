## About Me:
Using data, I would like to know where a certain basketball player is the most productive on the court based on play-by-play data. Six months after graduation I would love to be relaxing after 5pm instead of doing homework late into the night. Five years after graduation I hope that I have a stable job and that I'm starting to figure out what I want from my career. I hope my greatest career accomplishment is to have a "C" in my title someday. In this course, I hope to refresh my statistics knowledge, sharpen my skills in R, and apply a little of what I learned in Markov Chains to data science. Finally, I love playing basketball--I am on staff with the Women's Basketball team as a practice player. From my enjoyment of being a pracice player, an alternate career path for me would be coaching college basketball.
