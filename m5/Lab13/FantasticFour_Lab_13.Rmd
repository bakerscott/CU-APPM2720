# Contributions
* Lindsay: Contributed to write up and analysis, as well as overall question significance.

* Lexie: Helped create overall question to answer and steps to answer it.

* Li: Plotted correlation between life expectancy and population size by using ggplot2, deplyr and magrittr.

* Scott: Wrote all the function in 'Functions Defined' section to be used with the rest of the writeup. Had one issue--using ggplot in a function (as you've noticed, there is some repeat code) wouldn't allow me to put mean 'geom_vline' in the plots for both subquestions. Additionally, completed both subquestions, managed files, and submitted.
