#reading the data into a dataset: from here on out, there will only be functions

# Functions Defined
```{r}
#here is where we define all our functions being used:
showLevels <- function(data_input){
  print(unique(data_input$country))
}

```{r}

## SubQ1
```{r}
# How does life expectancy vary by continent and by decade? Write functions and employ iteration to calculate 5 statistics (min, max, mean, median, IQR=difference between 75%tile and 25%tile) for each continent for each decade.

```

## SubQ1
```{r}
# How does GDP per capita vary by continent and by decade? Write functions and employ iteration to calculate 5 statistics (min, max, mean, median, IQR=difference between 75%tile and 25%tile) for each continent for each decade.
