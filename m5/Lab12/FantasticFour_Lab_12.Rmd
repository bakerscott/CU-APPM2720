#reading the data into a dataset: from here on out, there will only be functions

# Functions Defined
```{r}
#for defining functions (?):
showLevels <- function(data_input){
  print(unique(data_input))
}

lifeExpectancyStats <- function(data_input,continent_in,start_year,end_year)
  x <- data_input %>% filter(continent == continent_in,year>=start_year,year<=end_year) #summary(data_input$lifeExp)
  summary(x)
```
# Main part

```{r}
#showLevels(gapminder$country)

lifeExpectancyStats(gapminder,"Africa",1950,1959)

## SubQ1
```{r}
# How does life expectancy vary by continent and by decade? Write functions and employ iteration to calculate 5 statistics (min, max, mean, median, IQR=difference between 75%tile and 25%tile) for each continent for each decade.

```

## SubQ1
```{r}
# How does GDP per capita vary by continent and by decade? Write functions and employ iteration to calculate 5 statistics (min, max, mean, median, IQR=difference between 75%tile and 25%tile) for each continent for each decade.
